# 📩 SMS Spam Detection with Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to classify SMS text messages as **"spam"** or **"ham"** (not spam). It walks through a full pipeline of natural language processing (NLP), feature extraction, model training, and evaluation to build a robust spam classifier.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Understand and clean SMS text message data  
- Transform raw text into numerical features using **TF-IDF**  
- Train and compare different classification models  
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance with standard metrics  

---

## 🧹 Text Preprocessing

- Lowercasing text  
- Removing punctuation, numbers, and stopwords  
- Tokenization and stemming  
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**

---

## 📦 Models Used
